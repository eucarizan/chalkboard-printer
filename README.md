## learning
practice working with variables and different data types, logging messages to the console, and taking input from the user. use loops and functions to write a complete javascript program.

## about
if you remember the simpsons intro, you know there is a running joke about bart simpson writing sentences on a chalkboard as a punishment. similarly, this project aims to recreate that humorous experience by developing a javascript program that prints various jokes to the console. 

## stages
### 1: log your first joke
<details>
<summary>learn the basics of declaring and assigning variables. log a message to the console using these variables</summary>

#### 1.1 description
in the show's intro, bart simpson is tasked with writing a message multiple times on a chalkboard as a punishment. too bad he didn't know programming for this task. luckily, you know how to create a javascript program to do this.

like bart simpson, you must create a javascript program to log a message to the console multiple times.

in this stage, you will notice we've declared the variables you need to use. however, we've made a mistake. correct the error, assign the necessary values from the objectives section, and log the message five times.

>make sure to follow the output style given in the examples.

#### 1.2 objectives
you should:

1. declare a variable named `name` and assign the value `bart` to it.
2. declare a variable named `surname` and assign the value `simpson` to it.
3. declare a variable named `message` and assign the value `i will not skateboard in the halls.` to it.
4. log this message to the console using the variables above five times: `this is [name] [surname] and [message]`

#### 1.3 examples
example 1:
```
this is bart simpson and i will not skateboard in the halls.
this is bart simpson and i will not skateboard in the halls.
this is bart simpson and i will not skateboard in the halls.
this is bart simpson and i will not skateboard in the halls.
this is bart simpson and i will not skateboard in the halls.
```

### 2: ask the user
<details>
<summary>get input from the user and work with dynamic data to log messages on the console</summary>

#### 2.1 description
time to add some energy to our project! in this stage, instead of using static values, you will get input from the user and log the messages according to the user's input. we've imported the `sync-input` library that you must use to take input from the user.

follow the output style given in the examples.

#### 2.2 objectives
you should:

1. take the input for the `name` variable.
2. take the input for the `surname` variable.
3. take the input for the `message` variable.
4. log this message to the console using the variables above five times: `this is [name] [surname] and [message]`

#### 2.3 examples
the greater-than symbol followed by a space (`> `) represents the user input. note that it's not part of the input.

example 1:
```
enter name: > bart
enter surname: > simpson
enter message: > i will not skateboard in the halls.
this is bart simpson and i will not skateboard in the halls.
this is bart simpson and i will not skateboard in the halls.
this is bart simpson and i will not skateboard in the halls.
this is bart simpson and i will not skateboard in the halls.
this is bart simpson and i will not skateboard in the halls.
```
