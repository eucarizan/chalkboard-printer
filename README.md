## learning
practice working with variables and different data types, logging messages to the console, and taking input from the user. use loops and functions to write a complete javascript program.

## about
if you remember the simpsons intro, you know there is a running joke about bart simpson writing sentences on a chalkboard as a punishment. similarly, this project aims to recreate that humorous experience by developing a javascript program that prints various jokes to the console. 

## stages
### 1: log your first joke
<details>
<summary>learn the basics of declaring and assigning variables. log a message to the console using these variables</summary>

#### 1.1 description
in the show's intro, bart simpson is tasked with writing a message multiple times on a chalkboard as a punishment. too bad he didn't know programming for this task. luckily, you know how to create a javascript program to do this.

like bart simpson, you must create a javascript program to log a message to the console multiple times.

in this stage, you will notice we've declared the variables you need to use. however, we've made a mistake. correct the error, assign the necessary values from the objectives section, and log the message five times.

>make sure to follow the output style given in the examples.

#### 1.2 objectives
you should:

1. declare a variable named `name` and assign the value `bart` to it.
2. declare a variable named `surname` and assign the value `simpson` to it.
3. declare a variable named `message` and assign the value `i will not skateboard in the halls.` to it.
4. log this message to the console using the variables above five times: `this is [name] [surname] and [message]`

#### 1.3 examples
example 1:
```
this is bart simpson and i will not skateboard in the halls.
this is bart simpson and i will not skateboard in the halls.
this is bart simpson and i will not skateboard in the halls.
this is bart simpson and i will not skateboard in the halls.
this is bart simpson and i will not skateboard in the halls.
```
